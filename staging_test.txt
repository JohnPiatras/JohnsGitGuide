Yet another sentence.
This sentence was added in the add-page-about-branching branch before the merge.
This sentence was added to the master branch after the add-page-about-branching branch was created, but before it was merged into master.

This was added in master after creating another-branch. In another-branch we will make another edit to this file, then have a look at merging branches via the command line.

This text was add in another-branch. After adding it I will commit and push this branch. Then, locally, I will merge it back in to master.
