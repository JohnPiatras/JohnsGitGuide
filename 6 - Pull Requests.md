# Pull Requests
Often we will be working as part of a team on a project which means that one person may be working on new feature in a branch, will someone else works on other features or bug fixes in another branch.

Eventually the time will come to merge your branch in to master, but master may have had commits made that your branch does not.

This is were the Pull Requests come in - we want to pull changes into master.

To simulate this I briefly checked out master and added a sentence to the ```staging_test.txt``` file I created earlier which was then commited and pushed to the remote repository. I have since checked out out ```add-page-about-branches``` again to write this page about Pull Requests. This branch does not contain the edit to ```staging_test.txt```.

I am now going commit what I have in this branch, and push that to the repository as well, create a pull request and merge everything back to master while taking screenshots along the way.
